## Movement

### Ground Movement

- Running speed is controlled by `xv`. The player accelerates at **3 units/tick**
  when a direction key is held and decelerates at **2 units/tick** when released.
- On slopes (STAIRSUP / STAIRSDOWN), the engine follows the surface by mapping
  `x` to `y` via the platform's slope function.

### Jumping

- Jump applies an impulse of **−17** to `yv` (upward), modified by
  `jump_impulse` (agency bonus; Noxis gets −3 extra).
- Jumping from a ladder with no horizontal input applies a stronger impulse of
  **−29**.
- Jumping from a ladder with the `activate` key held applies a weaker impulse
  of **−8** (for precise movement).

### Jetpack

- When `jetpack` input is active and fuel > 0, the player enters JETPACK
  state.
- Fuel decreases by **1 each tick** while the jetpack is active.
- When fuel reaches 0, the `fuel_low` flag is set and the jetpack cannot be
  reactivated until the player lands.
- Jetpack horizontal speed is capped at **±14**.
- Jetpack vertical speed is capped at **−9** (upward).
- Base fuel is 80; agency upgrades add **+10 per jetpack level**.
- A jetpack power-up grants bonus fuel time.

### Ladder

- A player grabs a ladder when pressing up or down while overlapping a LADDER
  platform and the horizontal center is close enough.
- On a ladder, gravity does not apply. The player moves up/down at
  **1 unit/tick**.

## Health & Shield

- **Shield** absorbs damage first. Each projectile has separate `shield_damage`
  and `health_damage` values.
- If the target has a shield and the projectile does **not** bypass shields:
  - Shield takes `shield_damage`.
  - If shield is depleted by the hit, overflow damage is calculated:
    `overflow = (abs(shield − shield_damage) / shield_damage) × health_damage`
    and applied to health.
- If the target has no shield or the projectile **bypasses** shields:
  - Health takes `health_damage` directly.
- When health reaches 0, the entity enters its death state.

## Poison

- Poison is applied by certain items (poison, poison flare).
- Poison amount increases by the item's value, capped at **9**
  (`max_poisoned`).
- Poison can only be applied to players on a different team.
- Poison is cleared on death or by using a heal machine.

## Disguise

- Players can activate a disguise (`disguise` input). While disguised
  (`disguised >= 100`), the player appears as a civilian to other players and
  to guards.
- Firing a weapon, using items, or taking certain actions automatically
  **removes** the disguise.

## Invisibility

- Granted by the invisibility power-up. While active, the player is invisible
  to guards, robots, and other players.
- Has a time limit tracked by `invisible_bonus_time`.

## Inventory

The player has **4 inventory slots**. Each slot holds one item type and a
quantity count.

| Inventory Item | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| NONE | Empty slot |
| HEALTHPACK | Restores health to maximum when used |
| LAZARUSTRACT | Converts a nearby civilian to the player's team |
| SECURITYPASS | Guards ignore the player in the field |
| VIRUS | Infects a nearby robot or cannon, or disables an enemy tech station |
| POISON | Poisons a nearby enemy player |
| NEUTRONBOMB | Kills all entities in the region (except those inside a base) |
| EMPBOMB | EMP grenade |
| SHAPEDBOMB | Directional upward explosion |
| PLASMABOMB | High-damage area grenade |
| PLASMADET | Remote-detonated explosive |
| FIXEDCANNON | Deployable auto-turret |
| FLARE | Stationary area-denial torch |
| POISONFLARE | Flare that also poisons victims |
| BASEDOOR | Relocates the team's base entrance |
| CAMERA | Remote viewing device |

Every player starts with one **BASEDOOR** in their inventory.

## Weapons

Players can switch between 4 weapon slots:

| Slot | Weapon | Ammo | Max Ammo |
|------|--------|------|----------|
| 0 | Blaster | Infinite | — |
| 1 | Laser | `laser_ammo` | 30 |
| 2 | Rocket | `rocket_ammo` | 30 |
| 3 | Flamer | `flamer_ammo` | 75 |

Switching to a weapon slot that has 0 ammo falls back to the Blaster (slot 0).

See [04 — Weapons & Projectiles](04-weapons-and-projectiles.md) for detailed
weapon stats.

## Base Interaction

- Players enter a base by pressing `activate` near a discovered BaseDoor.
- Inside their own base, players can interact with:
  - **HealMachine** — restore health and shield to maximum (cooldown: 240
    ticks / 10 seconds).
  - **CreditMachine** — convert carried files to credits. Credits awarded =
    `files × (1 + credits_bonus)`.
  - **SecretReturn** — deliver a carried secret to score.
  - **InventoryStation** — open the buy menu.
  - **TechStation** — repair or virus enemy tech.
- Players can only buy items when near an InventoryStation inside their own
  base.

## Respawning

1. On death, the player enters DYING → DEAD.
2. From DEAD, after 48 ticks or on `activate` press:
   - **Lazarus agency** players who have not yet used their resurrection
     ability enter RESURRECTING (self-revive on the spot).
   - Otherwise, the player warps to their base (RESPAWNING) with full
     health/shield.
   - If no base exists, the player warps to a random spawn location.
